# Linked List ⛓

> The Linked List is a datastructure for storing a list collection of data items in an unknown order.

Each data item is made with a relationsip to its nextNode.
This creates a nested data structure versus an array-like structure for containing a list of data items.

This is the Linked List Package of [**Data Structures TS**](https://github.com/yowainwright/datastructures-ts).
