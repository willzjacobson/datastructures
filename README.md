> **Data Structures in TypeScript:** if learning Types wasn't enough, I'm adding datastructures to it. ğŸ˜³

This project is built with little understanding of Data Structures or TypeScript. Have fun with those facts!
Most commits were done after looking at repos such as [this](https://github.com/eyas-ranjous/datastructures-js/) by Eyas Ranjous, then crying a bit.

## Data Structures

The list below contains common Data Structures.
Each list item provides links to help go from **"what the f\**k?"** to **"Duh, obviously simply trivial."**.

## Linked List

 > The [Link List](/packages/linked-list/) is one of the most common Data Structures. Ask any developer about it if you would like to instantly feel like an idiot.

The [Linked List](/packages/linked-list/) is a Linear Structure of Nodes. Each Node is a seperate object. Go to [DataStructures TS, Linked List](/packages/linked-list/) for more detail.
