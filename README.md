> **Data Structures in TypeScript:** if learning Types wasn't enough, I'm adding datastructures to it. ðŸ˜³

This project is built with little understanding of Data Structures or TypeScript. Have fun with those facts!
Most commits were done after looking at repos such as [this](https://github.com/eyas-ranjous/datastructures-js/) by Eyas Ranjous, then crying a bit.

## Data Structures

The list below contains common Data Structures.
Each list item provides links to help go from **"what the f\**k?"** to **"Duh, obviously simply trivial."**.

### Linked List Node

 > The Link List Node is one of the most common Data Structures. Ask any developer about it if you would like to instantly feel like an idiot.

The Linked List Node is a Linear Structure of Nodes. Each node is a seperate object.
